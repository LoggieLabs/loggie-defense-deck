Slide 1 — Title

Loggie

Independent Cryptographic Proof for Operational Systems

Integrity infrastructure for autonomous, regulated, and high-trust environments.

(No italics. Keep it institutional.)

Slide 2 — The Problem

Operational systems produce logs, telemetry, AI decisions, and compliance records at scale.

These records are not independently verifiable.

Audit trails are controlled by the systems they monitor. When integrity is questioned, evidence can be disputed or insufficient. There is no neutral proof of what occurred.

(Removed “altered or lost” — that language can sound accusatory.)

Slide 3 — Why Now

Autonomous operations are expanding across commercial and defense environments.

Regulatory enforcement — including CMMC, FAA, and enterprise governance — is accelerating.

Litigation and insurance scrutiny increasingly require independently verifiable records.

Centralized audit infrastructure lacks structural independence.

We are entering an accountability era.

(“Growing distrust” removed — distrust sounds political.)

Slide 4 — The Core Solution

Loggie provides:

Tamper-evident record anchoring

Cryptographic timestamping

Identity-bound submissions

Independent chain-of-custody verification

Loggie does not replace storage.
Loggie establishes integrity.

“Establishes” reads more institutional than “proves.”

Slide 5 — Architecture Overview

Three-tier model:

Tier 1 — Source Systems
Customer-controlled files, telemetry, logs, and operational records.

Tier 2 — Loggie Integrity Layer
Records are hashed, batched, and anchored with cryptographic timestamps and identity binding.

Tier 3 — Optional Anchor Layer
Periodic root commitments to a private or third-party notarization layer for independent verification.

No sensitive data is transmitted to public networks. Only cryptographic commitments leave the integrity layer.

(“Transmitted” is cleaner than “stored.”)

Slide 6 — Deployment Modes

Private Mode
Fully internal deployment. No external anchoring. Enterprise-controlled.

Consortium Mode
Shared verification across authorized parties. Private infrastructure.

Public Notarization Mode
Periodic root anchoring to a third-party notarization layer. Independently verifiable.

(Clean and balanced.)

Slide 7 — Initial Focus

Autonomous and Regulated Operational Workflows

Commercial drone compliance

Medical transport records

High-trust AI output verification

Regulated enterprise audit workflows

(Narrow. Disciplined.)

Slide 8 — Example Applications

Autonomous Systems
Flight log integrity. Firmware version proof. Incident reconstruction.

Provenance and Attribution
Research and IP attribution. Grant submission records.

Compliance and Audit
CMMC evidence anchoring. Incident report integrity. Policy version proof.

Application examples — not separate products.

(Removed em dash sentence for simplicity.)

Slide 9 — Why Loggie Is Different

Independent from the system operator

Cryptographic integrity at the record level

Optional third-party notarization

Post-quantum-ready cryptographic foundation

Minimal integration footprint

(“Post-quantum-ready” softens the claim.)

Slide 10 — Omnituum

The cryptographic engine underlying Loggie.

Identity primitives

Hybrid encryption

Post-quantum readiness

Secure envelope infrastructure

Omnituum provides the cryptographic substrate.
Loggie provides the operational integrity layer built upon it.

(“Underlying” sounds less like branding.)

Slide 11 — Go-to-Market

Phase 1
Targeted commercial pilots within regulated operational workflows.

Phase 2
Defense-adjacent compliance integration and broader enterprise deployment.

(Removed “support.” Stronger.)

Slide 12 — Vision

Payments infrastructure was standardized.
Compute infrastructure was standardized.

Integrity infrastructure will be standardized.

Loggie becomes the independent proof layer beneath high-trust systems.

(This avoids startup comparison framing.)
