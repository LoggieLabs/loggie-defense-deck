Loggie Pitch Deck — Master Design Prompt
You are generating individual slide images for a 12-slide enterprise pitch deck. Every slide must follow these specifications exactly to maintain visual consistency across the full deck.
Canvas
16:9 aspect ratio. 1920×1080 pixels.
Background
Solid dark navy (#0B1120). No gradients. No textures. No patterns. No grain.
Typography
Primary headlines: White (#FFFFFF), clean sans-serif (Inter, Helvetica Neue, or equivalent), semibold, 36–44pt equivalent.
Subheadlines and body: Soft gray (#B0B8C8), regular weight, 18–22pt equivalent.
Accent labels (tier names, mode names, phase labels): Desaturated muted green (#6B9B8A) or muted violet (#8A7FB5), medium weight, 14–18pt equivalent. Pick one accent color and use it for the entire deck.
No italics anywhere. No underlines.
Layout
Left-aligned text unless the slide is a centered title slide (Slide 1 and Slide 12 only).
Generous margins — minimum 10% padding on all sides.
Maximum 60% of the slide area should contain content. The remaining space is intentional white space.
No more than 4 bullet points per slide.
Bullet points use a small square or minimal dash — no circles, no icons, no checkmarks.
Line spacing: 1.5x minimum.
Logo
Top left corner on every slide except Slide 1.
"LOGGIE" in clean white caps, small, 12pt equivalent. No icon. No glow. No tagline next to it.
On Slide 1, the logo is centered and larger (28–32pt equivalent).
Diagrams (when specified)
Flat rectangles with 1px borders in the accent color.
Thin connecting lines or arrows in soft gray (#B0B8C8).
No shadows. No 3D. No rounded corners. No glow effects.
Labels inside or below shapes in soft gray at 14–16pt.
Columns (when specified)
Even spacing. Separated by vertical thin lines in (#1A2540) or by spacing alone — no boxes, no cards, no background fills.
Global prohibitions
No gradients anywhere.
No glow effects.
No neon colors.
No stock photography.
No icons.
No decorative elements.
No drop shadows.
No rounded UI cards.
No dark mode SaaS aesthetic.
No startup energy.
The deck must feel like:
A classified infrastructure briefing document. Palantir investor materials. An AWS whitepaper cover. Anduril capability overview.
